# Task 7 - Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
Learn to identify and remove potentially harmful or unused browser extensions to improve browser security.

## Steps Performed
1. Opened browser extension manager (chrome://extensions/).
2. Reviewed all installed extensions and checked their permissions, status, and reviews.
3. Identified suspicious or unused extensions.
4. Removed the suspicious extensions.
5. Restarted browser and verified performance improvements.

## Extensions Removed
- *Gimp Online (Image Editor and Paint Tool)*: Marked as "Not trusted" by Chrome and could pose security risks.
- *OSINT*: No longer supported.
- *Open Cookies.txt*: No longer supported and unnecessary.

## Best Practices Learned
- Install extensions only from trusted developers.
- Avoid extensions requiring excessive permissions (e.g., "read and change all your data").
- Remove unused or outdated extensions regularly.
- Keep browser and extensions updated for security.
